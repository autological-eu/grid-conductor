# Coordinating chronological storage inventories

The sequential 2025 monthly run preserves inventory continuity, but each month chooses its ending inventory without optimising future water value. It is a feasible chronological reference, not an annual optimum. The new coordinator addresses that missing optimisation; it remains under validation.

## Shared boundary states

Let $x_m$ contain reservoir and battery inventories at boundary $m$. A local block retains every hourly generation, flow, charging, discharging, spill and inventory variable. Only its starting and ending inventories are shared. With fixed capacity and continuous dispatch, each block is an LP:

$$q_m(x)=\min_{y_m} c_m^T y_m,$$

subject to

$$A_m y_m+B_m x=b_m,\qquad U_m y_m+V_m x\le r_m.$$

Inventory bounds live in the master. Originally cyclic assets require $x_0=x_{12}$, with the starting inventory optimised rather than silently fixed to zero. Noncyclic assets retain the source initial condition. Generator ramping, unit commitment, Stores, annual fuel/emissions budgets and expansion require additional shared state or constraints; unsupported features must fail rather than disappear.

## Objective and feasibility cuts

At a feasible candidate $x^k$, local duals give a subgradient $g_m$. The master accumulates supporting planes:

$$\theta_m\ge q_m(x^k)+g_m^T(x-x^k).$$

Minimising $\sum_m\theta_m$ gives a lower bound. Solving all blocks at one feasible shared state gives an upper bound. Independent block relaxations initialise valid objective floors; zero is not assumed when that would be invalid.

A proposed state can be infeasible—for example, a reservoir cannot reach a requested level with the available inflow and charging capability. A separate Phase-I LP minimises nonnegative violations of its equality and inequality constraints. Its duals generate a necessary feasibility cut:

$$\phi_m(x^k)+h_m^T(x-x^k)\le0.$$

Phase-I slack is a diagnostic used to exclude infeasible boundary proposals. It is never treated as genuine energy supply or an acceptable dispatch result.

## Convergence and validation

The implementation reports lower bound, best feasible upper bound and their gap on every iteration. It stops successfully only when

$$UB-LB\le\epsilon_{abs}+\epsilon_{rel}\max(1,|UB|).$$

An iteration limit means **not certified**. A lower bound materially above a feasible upper bound is an error. Numerical tolerances mean the reported gap is an LP solver certificate, not a formal exact-arithmetic proof.

`tools/storage_coordinator.py` implements the cut algorithm. `tools/pypsa_storage_blocks.py` exports native Linopy matrix coefficients and introduces explicit boundary inventories. It preserves hourly chronology, storage efficiencies and standing losses. Tests compare the coordinator with both a monolithic analytical LP and a native PyPSA model with cyclic inventory, asymmetric efficiency and standing loss; infeasible proposals and iteration-limit handling are tested separately.

`tools/validate_2025_coordination.py` additionally compares two 24-hour blocks against the saved 48-hour conditional native 2025 reference. That experiment uses fixed initial and terminal inventories, not the annual cyclic boundary. Passing it cannot establish full-year optimality.

## Remaining annual gate

The twelve-month production coordinator has not been validated or certified. Retaining all yearly LP matrices in memory would undermine the memory-saving purpose; the production driver needs streamed block workers, guarded resources and resumable cuts/checkpoints. A real annual run must retain the original free cyclic initial inventories, unsupported-feature gates and published availability inputs. No annual investment results should be derived from a nonconverged bound or extrapolated from the 48-hour benchmark.

The real-network reference run encountered a numerical Phase-I failure after
29 iterations and had not converged (last gap approximately €885,049).
The driver now records failures explicitly, retries HiGHS numerical-status
failures with dual simplex and presolve disabled, and saves atomic cut/bound
checkpoints for resumption. These changes are recovery mechanisms, not evidence
that the network reference or annual model has converged.
